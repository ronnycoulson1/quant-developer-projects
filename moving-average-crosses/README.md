# Moving Average Crossover Strategy

This project implements a basic moving average crossover trading strategy using Python. It simulates buying when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, and selling when it crosses below.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Load historical data** using `yfinance`.
2. **Define strategy** using short and long moving averages.
3. **Run backtest** to simulate trades.
4. **Evaluate metrics** such as total return, win rate, and Sharpe ratio.
5. **Plot results** including price chart and trade signals.
